memory and focus training app

# Brane
This is a Free/Libre and Open Source memory game made with Godot.
The idea is to make a memory and focus training app.
### The game is set in 3 stages:
- step 1: remember something
- step 2: be engaged by a problem
- step 3: recall that thing from step 1

### configuration:
There are multiple configurations to tailor the difficulties to youre liking.
For now, there are just 3 settings. There will be more settings available by the game is done.
- Difficulty: is ment to set the complexity level of the thinking part of the game.
- focus: set the amount of math problems to solve
- number size: size of the number to recall

## Definition of done
Will be decided after review and brainstorm with friends
#### memory
- [ ] associate names and colors
- [ ] remember the grocery list
- [ ] TODO: one more thing?? (directions ???)(maybe i don't need one more thing for now?)

#### focus
- [ ] update math difficulty
- [ ] find the extra character :
display multiple buttons with strings of characters and the player needs to find the one that doesnt match the other 2.

The chars are not necesarily in order but you need to find the one with the diffenrent number of a's for example : halskdlajdksjdnw & hfjdskajfhdbfjajfdfaf & poiufdsfuapandfmnbda.
the second and the third have 3 a's and the first has 2 and for this example we will consider they have the same amount of all the other letters.

- TODO: find more focusing tasks
